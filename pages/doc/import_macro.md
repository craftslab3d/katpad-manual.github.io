Importing Macros is the easier and fastest way to add macros to your KatPad.

In the Crafts Lab's server there are some essential macros available per application.

The process is simple:
1. Choose an application clicking on download button
2. You will see the macros available
3. You can choose all by checking the first checkbox or choose some by choosing one by one
4. Choose a tag if you have
5. If there is enough slots the `Import` button will be available, otherwise it will be disabled and you need get rid of some macros first.
