To order to create the KatPad Programmer Server, the KatPad needs to connects on your WIFI and to do so, you need to configure your WIFI first.

At the first time using your KatPad, it doesn't have those information, then the KatPad will create it own WIFI (KATPAD-WIFI-AP) to be possible save it there, while doing this you won't have internet connection.

Also, here is possible to inform a suffix for the address. It's necessary if you have more than one KatPad connected in the same WIFI even using a WIFI extension. Or if you want just personalize this address.

{% include note.html content="If you don't inform a suffix, it will continue been `www.katpad-programmer.local`" %}

{% include warning.html content="Remember! While connected at `KATPAD-WIFI-AP`, you won't have internet connection. So, it's important configure your WIFI in order to access `www.katpad-programmer.local` and your internet at the same time." %}
